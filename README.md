# Password-generator

## Overview
Created an application that can be used to generate a random password based on criteria the user choses when the generate password button is pressed. 

They will be presented with a series of prompt boxes at the top of the page where they must select:
 * how many characters they want their password to have (between 10 and 64);
 * whether they want:
    * Lowercase Characters;
    * Uppercase Characters;
    * Numerical Characters;
    * Special Characters;

This application runs in the browers and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by the Javascript code that has been added.

Experience a responsive, clean interface that can be used on multiple screen sizes;

Would not have been able to complete this challenge without the help of everyone in my course (TA's & coursemates & Omar) nor without the major help of Google, W3Schools and mdn web docs. God Bless the Internet!
